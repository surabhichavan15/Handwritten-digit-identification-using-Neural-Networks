Handwritten Digit Identification using Neural Networks

Overview
This project aims to identify handwritten digits using neural networks. The dataset contains images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Neural networks are trained on the dataset to recognize the digits.

Data Source
The dataset used in this project is available in the MNIST database.

Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Tensorflow
Keras

Steps Involved

1. Data Preparation:
Loads the dataset and preprocesses it for use with neural networks.

2. Model Building:
Builds a neural network using Tensorflow and Keras.

3. Model Training:
Trains the neural network using the preprocessed data.

4. Model Evaluation:
Evaluates the performance of the neural network on a test dataset.

5. Prediction:
Uses the final model to predict the handwritten digits in the test dataset.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use neural networks to identify handwritten digits. By following the steps outlined in this project, one can learn how to preprocess data for use with neural networks, build and train a neural network using Tensorflow and Keras, and evaluate the performance of the model.
